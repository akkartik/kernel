Mu's fork of the Linux kernel
=============================

This is the fork used by Mu (https://github.com/akkartik/mu) to create
minimal bootable ISOs. It will continue to track upstream, and it will
gradually drop features from upstream. It's in a separate repo to make
tracking convenient.

Don't clone or pull this repo directly. I'm still figuring out the best way to
stay abreast of upstream changes, and in the meantime I will be constantly
rebasing this repo on upstream.

Rough update process:
```
git pull --rebase upstream master
git rebase --continue >&x
grep CONFLICT x |grep modify/delete |column 3 |xargs git rm --force >& y
```
